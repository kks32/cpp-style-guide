  <STYLEPOINT title="Displaying Hidden Details in this Guide">
     <SUMMARY>
       This style guide contains many details that are initially
       hidden from view.  They are marked by the triangle icon, which you
       see here on your left.  Click it now. You should see "Hooray"
       appear below.
     </SUMMARY>
     <BODY>
       <p>
        Hooray!  Now you know you can expand points to get more
        details.  Alternatively, there's an "expand all" at the
        top of this document.

<CATEGORY title="Background">
  <p>
    C++ is the main development language for most of our projects.
    The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by describing
    in detail the dos and don'ts of writing C++ code. These rules exist to
    keep the code base manageable while still allowing coders to use 
    C++ language features productively. One way in which we keep the
    code base manageable is by enforcing <em>consistency</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that this guide is not a C++ tutorial.

</OVERVIEW>


<CATEGORY title="Naming">
  <p>
    The most important consistency rules are those that govern
    naming. The style of a name immediately informs us what sort of
    thing the named entity is: a type, a variable, a function, a
    constant, a macro, etc., without requiring us to search for the
    declaration of that entity.     
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that a maintaining a consistent style is often more important
    than doing every little detail in the way you think best.
  </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="General Naming Rules">
    <SUMMARY>
      Function names, variable names, and filenames should be
      descriptive; eschew abbreviation.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Do
        not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far more
        important to make your code immediately understandable by a
        new reader. Do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or
        unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not
        abbreviate by deleting letters within a word. Short names,
	such as x and i, are meaningful when used conventionally; 
	that is, x should be a local variable or a parameter and 
	i should be a loop index. 
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        int number_particles_;   // No abbreviation.
        int num_errors;          // "num" is a widespread convention.
        int num_mpm_point;       // Most people know what "mpm" stands for.
        for (int i = 0; ...      // Used conventionally as a loop index.
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        int n;                   // Meaningless.
        int nerr;                // Ambiguous abbreviation.
        int n_comp_conns;        // Ambiguous abbreviation.
        int lem_connections;     // Only your group knows what this stands for.
        int pc_reader;           // Lots of things can be abbreviated "pc".
        int prtcl_id;            // Deletes internal letters.
        int the_number_of_elements_in_a_cell 
                                 // A bit too long.
      </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="File Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      Filenames should be all lowercase and can include underscores
      (<code>_</code>). C++ files should end in <code>.cc</code> and
      header files should end in <code>.h</code>. Follow the conventions 
      of your project.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Examples of acceptable file names:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          particle_soil_mpm.cc<br/>
          particlesoilmpm.cc<br/>
          particlesoilmpm_test.cc  // _unittest and _regtest are deprecated.<br/>
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not use filenames that already exist
        in <code>/usr/include</code>, such as <code>error.h</code>.
      </p>      
      <p>
        In general, make your filenames very specific.  For example,
        use <code>particle_soil_mpm.h</code> rather
        than <code>particle.h</code>.  A very common case is to have a
        pair of files called, e.g., <code>foo_bar.h</code>
        and <code>foo_bar.cc</code>, defining a class
        called <code>FooBar</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inline functions must be in a <code>.h</code> file. 
	However, for shared template code the class definitions
	may go into a third file that ends in <code>.tcc</code>.  
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        particle_soil_mpm.h      // The class declaration.
        particle_soil_mpm.cc      // The class definition.
        particle_soil_mpm.tcc     // Templatised class definitions.
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
	Don't forget that header files require <a href="#The__define_Guard"><code>#define guard</code></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
	See <a href="#The_.tcc_Files"><code>.tcc</code> files</a> 
	for more information on how to defined shared templatised classes.
      </p>
   </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Type Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      Type names start with a capital letter and have a capital
      letter for each new word, with no underscores:
      <code>MpmParticleClass</code>, <code>MpmParticleEnum</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        The names of all types — classes, structs, typedefs, and enums
        — have the same naming convention.  Type names should start
        with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new
        word.  No underscores.
      </p>
      <p>
	When confronted with a situation where you could use an all
	upper case abbreviation instead use an initial upper case letter
	followed by all lower case letters. No matter what.
	For example:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // classes and structs
        class ParticleSoilMpm { ...
        class ParticleMpm { ...
        struct ParticleMpmProperties { ...

        // typedefs
        typedef hash_map&lt;ParticleMpm*, std::string&gt; PropertiesMap;

        // enums
        enum MpmErrors { ...
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Variable Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      Variable names are all lowercase, with underscores between
      words. Class member variables have trailing underscores.  For
      instance: <code>local_variable</code>,
      <code>member_variable_</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
	Don't use names beginning with "my". The word "my" isn't generally
	meaningful, since it can refer to any human in the world.
	If you want to personalize a class or variable name, give your class
	or variable a name that describes its function, not its authorship. 
      </p>
      <SUBSECTION title="Common Variable names">
        <p>
          For example:
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          std::string material_name;  // OK - uses underscore.
          std::string materialname;   // OK - all lowercase.
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
          std::string materialName;   // Bad - mixed case.
        </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
      </SUBSECTION>

      <SUBSECTION title="Class Data Members">
        <p>
          Data members (also called instance variables or member
          variables) are lowercase with optional underscores like
          regular variable names, but always end with a trailing
          underscore.
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          std::string material_name_;  // OK - underscore at end.
          std::string materialname_;   // OK.
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </SUBSECTION>

      <SUBSECTION title="Struct Variables">
        <p>
          Data members in structs should be named like regular
          variables without the trailing underscores that data members
          in classes have.
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          struct ParticleMpmProperties {
            std::string name;
            int num_points;
          }
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          See <a href="#Structs_vs._Classes">Structs vs. Classes</a> for a
          discussion of when to use a struct versus a class.
        </p>
      </SUBSECTION>
      
      <SUBSECTION title="Enumerator Variables">
	<p>
	  Enumerator variables in <code>enum</code> should be named like
	  regular variables.
	</p>
	<CODE_SNIPPET>
        enum MpmMaterials { linear_elastic, bingham, camclay };
	</CODE_SNIPPET>
      </SUBSECTION>

      <SUBSECTION title="Global Variables">
        <p>
          Really? are you going to use global variables in your code?
	  If your code requires global variables, think again, and 
	  restructure your code. In worst case, define your
	  global variables as <code>const</code>inside a namespace.
        </p>
      </SUBSECTION>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Function Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      Functions should be lower case; accessors and mutators match
      the name of the variable: <code>particle_function()</code>,
      <code>particle_method()</code>,
      <code>member_variable()</code>,
      <code>set_member_variable()</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <SUBSECTION title="Regular Functions">
        <p>
          Functions should be lower case. Use underscores to seperate words.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your function crashes upon an error, you should append _or_die to
          the function name. This only applies to functions which could be
          used by production code and to errors that are reasonably
          likely to occur during normal operation.
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          add_new_material()
          delete_material_point()
          open_file_or_die()
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </SUBSECTION>

      <SUBSECTION title="Accessors and Mutators">
        <p>
          Accessors and mutators (get and set functions) should match
          the name of the variable they are getting and setting.  This
          shows an excerpt of a class whose instance variable is
          <code>num_materials_</code>.
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
        class MpmMaterials {
        public:
        ...
        int num_materials() const 
        {
            return num_materials_; 
        }
        void set_num_materials(int num_materials) 
        {
          num_materials_ = num_materials;
        }
        
        private:
        int num_materials_;
        };

        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          You may also use lowercase letters for other very short
          inlined functions. For example if a function were so cheap
          you would not cache the value if you were calling it in a
          loop, then lowercase naming would be acceptable.
        </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Namespace Names">
    
    <SUMMARY>
      Namespace names are all lower-case, and keep it meaningful
      <code>mpm_material</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        See <a href="#Namespaces">Namespaces</a> for a discussion of
        namespaces and how to name them.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Macro Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      You're not really going to <A href="#Preprocessor_Macros">define
      a macro</A>, are you? 
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Please see the <a href="#Preprocessor_Macros">description of
        macros</a>; in general macros should <em>not</em> be used.
        However, the only exception being <code>#define</code> guards,
	then they should be named with all capitals and underscores.
	Macros should not be used for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
	Use facilities from the C++ language proper, such as inline 
	functions, templates, constructors (for initialization),
	destructors (for cleanup), exceptions (for exiting contexts), etc
	instead of using Macros.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Exceptions to Naming Rules">
    <SUMMARY>
      If you are naming something that is analogous to an existing C
      or C++ entity then you can follow the existing naming convention
      scheme.

<CATEGORY title="Header Files">
  <p>
    In general, every <code>.cc</code> file should have an associated
    <code>.h</code> file. There are some common exceptions, such as
    
    unittests
    and small <code>.cc</code> files containing just a <code>main()</code>
    function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to the
    readability, size and performance of your code.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following rules will guide you through the various pitfalls of
    using header files.
  </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="The #define Guard">
    <SUMMARY>
      All header files should have <code>#define</code> guards to
      prevent multiple inclusion.  The format of the symbol name
      should be
      <code><i>&lt;PROJECT&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;PATH&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i>_H_</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      
      <p>
        To guarantee uniqueness, they should be based on the full path
        in a project's source tree.  For example, the file
        <code>mpm/src/material/bingham.h</code> in project <code>mpm</code>
	should have the following guard:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
         #ifndef MPM_SRC_MATERIAL_BINGHAM_H_
         #define MPM_SRC_MATERIAL_BINGHAM_H_

         ...

         #endif  // MPM_SRC_MATERIAL_BINGHAM_H_
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Forward Declarations">
    <SUMMARY>
        You may forward declare ordinary classes in order to avoid
        unnecessary <code>#include</code>s.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
          A "forward declaration" is a declaration of a class, function,
          or template without an associated definition. <code>#include</code>
          lines can often be replaced with forward declarations of whatever
          symbols are actually used by the client code.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        <ul>
          <li>Unnecessary <code>#include</code>s force the compiler to open
          more files and process more input.</li>
          <li>They can also force your code to be recompiled more often, due
          to changes in the header.</li>
        </ul>
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        <ul>
          <li>It can be difficult to determine the correct form of a
          forward declaration in the presence of features like templates,
          typedefs, default parameters, and using declarations.</li>
          <li>It can be difficult to determine whether a forward declaration
          or a full <code>#include</code> is needed for a given piece of code,
          particularly when implicit conversion operations are involved. In
          extreme cases, replacing an <code>#include</code> with a forward
          declaration can silently change the meaning of code.</li>
          <li>Forward declaring multiple symbols from a header can be more
          verbose than simply <code>#include</code>ing the header.</li>
          <li>Forward declarations of functions and templates can prevent
          the header owners from making otherwise-compatible changes to
          their APIs; for example, widening a parameter type, or adding
          a template parameter with a default value.</li>
          <li>Forward declaring symbols from namespace <code>std::</code>
          usually yields undefined behavior.</li>
          <li>Structuring code to enable forward declarations (e.g.
          using pointer members instead of object members) can make the
          code slower and more complex.</li>
          <li>The practical efficiency benefits of forward declarations are
          unproven.</li>
        </ul>
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <ul>
          <li>When using a function declared in a header file, always
          <code>#include</code> that header.</li>
          <li>When using a class template, prefer to <code>#include</code> its
          header file.</li>
          <li>When using an ordinary class, relying on a forward declaration
          is OK, but be wary of situations where a forward declaration may
          be insufficient or incorrect; when in doubt, just
          <code>#include</code> the appropriate header.</li>
          <li>Do not replace data members with pointers just to avoid an
          <code>#include</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        Always <code>#include</code> the file that actually provides the
        declarations/definitions you need; do not rely on the symbol being
        brought in transitively via headers not directly included. One
        exception is that <code>mpmsoil.cc</code> may rely on
        <code>#include</code>s and forward declarations from its corresponding
        header file <code>mpmsoil.h</code>.
      </DECISION>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Inline Functions">
    <SUMMARY>
      Define functions inline only when they are small, say, 5 lines
      or less.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        You can declare functions in a way that allows the compiler to
        expand them inline rather than calling them through the usual
        function call mechanism.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Inlining a function can generate more efficient object code,
        as long as the inlined function is small. Feel free to inline
        accessors and mutators, and other short, performance-critical
        functions.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower.
        Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the code
        size to increase or decrease.  Inlining a very small accessor
        function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very
        large function can dramatically increase code size.  On modern
        processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use
        of the instruction cache.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
	<p>
          The definition of an inline function needs to be in a header
          file, so that the compiler has the definition available for
          inlining at the call sites.  However, implementation code
          properly belongs in <code>.cc</code> files, and we do not like
          to have much actual code in <code>.h</code> files unless there
          is a readability or performance advantage. For example,
	  accessors and mutators should certainly be inside 
	  a class definition.
	</p>
        <p>
          A decent rule of thumb is to not inline a function if it is
          more than 5 lines long. Beware of destructors, which are
          often longer than they appear because of implicit member-
          and base-destructor calls!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another useful rule of thumb: it's typically not cost
          effective to inline functions with loops or switch
          statements (unless, in the common case, the loop or switch
          statement is never executed).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to know that functions are not always
          inlined even if they are declared as such; for example,
          virtual and recursive functions are not normally inlined.
          Usually recursive functions should not be inline.  The main
          reason for making a virtual function inline is to place its
          definition in the class, either for convenience or to
          document its behavior, e.g., for accessors and mutators.

      You may use file extension <code>.tcc</code> for shared

    <BODY>
      <p>
	A template is not a class or a function. A template is a
	"pattern" that the compiler uses to generate a family of
	classes or functions.
      </p>
      <p>
	In order for the compiler to generate the code, it must 
	see both the template definition (not just declaration) and
	the specific types/whatever used to "fill in" the template.
	For example, if you're trying to use a <code>Foo&lt;int&gt;</code>,
	the compiler must see both the Foo template and the fact that 
	you're trying to make a specific <code>Foo&lt;int&gt;</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
	A common solution to this is to write the template declaration 
	in a header file, then implement the class in an implementation 
	file (for example .tcc), and include this implementation file
	at the end of the header.
      </p>
      <p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // foo.h

  <STYLEPOINT title="Function Parameter Ordering">
    <SUMMARY>
      When defining a function, parameter order is: inputs,
      then outputs.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Parameters to C/C++ functions are either input to the
        function, output from the function, or both. Input parameters
        are usually values or <code>const</code> references, while output
        and input/output parameters will be non-<code>const</code>
        pointers. When ordering function parameters, put all input-only
        parameters before any output parameters.  In particular, do not add
        new parameters to the end of the function just because they are
        new; place new input-only parameters before the output
        parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a hard-and-fast rule.  Parameters that are both
        input and output (often classes/structs) muddy the waters,
        and, as always, consistency with related functions may require
        you to bend the rule.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Names and Order of Includes">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use standard order for readability and to avoid hidden
      dependencies: C library, C++ library,
      
      other libraries' <code>.h</code>, your
      project's
      <code>.h</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        
        All of a project's header files should be
        listed as descendants of the project's source directory
        without use of UNIX directory shortcuts <code>.</code> (the current
        directory) or <code>..</code> (the parent directory).  For
        example,
        
        <code>mpm/src/material/bingham.h</code>
        should be included as
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        #include "material/bingham.h"
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        In <code><var>dir/foo</var>.cc</code> or <code><var>dir/foo_test</var>.cc</code>,
        whose main purpose is to implement or test the stuff in
        <code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code>, order your includes as
        follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> <code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code> (preferred location
          — see details below).</li>
        <li> C system files.</li>
        <li> C++ system files.</li>
        <li> Other libraries' <code>.h</code> files.</li>
        <li> 
             Your project's
             <code>.h</code> files.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With the preferred ordering, if <code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code>
        omits any necessary includes, the build of
        <code><var>dir/foo</var>.cc</code> or
        <code><var>dir/foo</var>_test.cc</code> will break.
        Thus, this rule ensures that build breaks show up first
        for the people working on these files, not for innocent people
        in other packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code><var>dir/foo</var>.cc</code> and
        <code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code> are often in the same
        directory (e.g. <code>base/basictypes_test.cc</code> and
        <code>base/basictypes.h</code>), but can be in different
        directories too.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Within each section the includes should be ordered alphabetically.
        Note that older code might not conform to this rule and should be
        fixed when convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the includes in
        
        <code>mpm/src/material/base/materialbase.cc</code>
        might look like this:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        #include "mpm/base/materialbase.h"  // Preferred location.

        #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
        #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
        #include &lt;std::vector&gt;

        #include "base/materialbase.h"
        #include "base/materialcontainer.h"
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        Exception: sometimes, system-specific code needs conditional includes.
        Such code can put conditional includes after other includes.
        Of course, keep your system-specific code small and localized.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Namespaces">
    <SUMMARY>
      Unnamed namespaces in <code>.cc</code> files are encouraged, 
      especially when using static variables.  With named namespaces, choose the name based on the project, and possibly
      its path.
      Do <emph>not</emph> use a <SYNTAX>using-directive</SYNTAX>.
      Do <emph>not</emph> use inline namespaces.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        Namespaces subdivide the global scope into distinct, named
        scopes, and so are useful for preventing name collisions in
        the global scope.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        <p>
          Namespaces provide a (hierarchical) axis of naming, in
          addition to the (also hierarchical) name axis provided by
          classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if two different projects have a class
          <code>Foo</code> in the global scope, these symbols may
          collide at compile time or at runtime.  If each project
          places their code in a namespace, <code>project1::Foo</code>
          and <code>project2::Foo</code> are now distinct symbols that
          do not collide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inline namespaces automatically place their names in the
          enclosing scope. Consider the following snippet, for example:
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
            namespace x {
            inline namespace y {
            void foo();
            }
            }
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          The expressions <code>x::y::foo()</code> and
          <code>x::foo()</code> are interchangeable. Inline namespaces
          are primarily intended for ABI compatibility across versions.
        </p>
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        <p>
          Namespaces can be confusing, because they provide an
          additional (hierarchical) axis of naming, in addition to the
          (also hierarchical) name axis provided by classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inline namespaces, in particular, can be confusing because
          names aren't actually restricted to the namespace where they
          are declared. They are only useful as part of some larger
          versioning policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use of unnamed namespaces in header files can easily cause
          violations of the C++ One Definition Rule (ODR).

    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        A class can define another class within it; this is also
        called a <SYNTAX>member class</SYNTAX>.
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          class Foo {

      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        This is useful when the nested (or member) class is only used
        by the enclosing class; making it a member puts it in the
        enclosing class scope rather than polluting the outer scope
        with the class name.  Nested classes can be forward declared
        within the enclosing class and then defined in the
        <code>.cc</code> file to avoid including the nested class
        definition in the enclosing class declaration, since the
        nested class definition is usually only relevant to the
        implementation.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Nested classes can be forward-declared only within the
        definition of the enclosing class. Thus, any header file
        manipulating a <code>Foo::Bar*</code> pointer will have to
        include the full class declaration for <code>Foo</code>.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        Do not make nested classes public unless they are actually
        part of the interface, e.g., a class that holds a set of
        options for some method.

      Prefer nonmember functions within a namespace or static member

    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <PROS>
        Nonmember and static member functions can be useful in some

        polluting the global namespace.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Nonmember and static member functions may make more sense as
        members of a new class, especially if they access external
        resources or have significant dependencies.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Sometimes it is useful, or even necessary, to define a
          function not bound to a class instance.  Such a function can
          be either a static member or a nonmember function.
          Nonmember functions should not depend on external variables,
          and should nearly always exist in a namespace.  Rather than
          creating classes only to group static member functions which
          do not share static data, use
          <a href="#Namespaces">namespaces</a> instead.

        <p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Local Variables">
    <SUMMARY>
      Place a function's variables in the narrowest scope possible,
      and initialize variables in the declaration.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        C++ allows you to declare variables anywhere in a function.
        We encourage you to declare them in as local a scope as
        possible, and as close to the first use as possible. This
        makes it easier for the reader to find the declaration and see
        what type the variable is and what it was initialized to.  In
        particular, initialization should be used instead of
        declaration and assignment, e.g.
      </p>
      <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        int i;
        i = f();      // Bad -- initialization separate from declaration.
      </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        int j = g();  // Good -- declaration has initialization.
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;
        v.push_back(1);  // Prefer initializing using brace initialization.
        v.push_back(2);
      </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1, 2};  // Good -- v starts initialized.
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        Note that gcc implements <code>for (int i = 0; i
        &lt; 10; ++i)</code> correctly (the scope of <code>i</code> is
        only the scope of the <code>for</code> loop), so you can then
        reuse <code>i</code> in another <code>for</code> loop in the
        same scope.  It also correctly scopes declarations in
        <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> statements, e.g.
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        while (const char* p = strchr(str, '/')) str = p + 1;
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        There is one caveat:  if the variable is an object, its
        constructor is invoked every time it enters scope and is
        created, and its destructor is invoked every time it goes
        out of scope.
      </p>
      <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        // Inefficient implementation:
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i) {
          Foo f;  // Constructor &amp; Destructor get called 1000000 times each.
          f.do_something(i);
        }
      </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        It may be more efficient to declare such a variable used in a
        loop outside that loop:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        Foo f;  // ctor and dtor get called once each.
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i) {
          f.do_something(i);
        }
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Static and Global Variables">
    <SUMMARY>
      Static or global variables of class type are forbidden: they cause
      hard-to-find bugs due to indeterminate order of construction and
      destruction.
      However, such variables are allowed if they are <code>constexpr</code>:
      they have no dynamic initialization or destruction.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
	Global variables are allowed, only when you declare them as <code>const</code>
	and are defined inside a namespace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects with static storage duration, including global variables,
        static variables, static class member variables, and function static
        variables, must be Plain Old Data (POD): only ints, chars, floats, or
        pointers, or arrays/structs of POD.
      </p>
      <p>
        The order in which class constructors and initializers for
        static variables are called is only partially specified in C++ and can
        even change from build to build, which can cause bugs that are difficult
        to find.  Therefore in addition to banning globals of class type, we do
        not allow static POD variables to be initialized with the result of a
        function, unless that function (such as getenv(), or getpid()) does not
        itself depend on any other globals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, global and static variables are destroyed when the
        program terminates, regardless of whether the termination is by
        returning from <code>main()</code> or by calling
        <code>exit()</code>. The order in which destructors are called is
        defined to be the reverse of the order in which the constructors
        were called.  Since constructor order is indeterminate, so is
        destructor order.  For example, at program-end time a static
        variable might have been destroyed, but code still running —
        perhaps in another thread — tries to access it and fails.  Or
        the destructor for a static <code>std::string</code> variable might be
        run prior to the destructor for another variable that contains a
        reference to that string.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to alleviate the destructor problem is to terminate the
        program by calling <code>quick_exit()</code> instead of
        <code>exit()</code>. The difference is that <code>quick_exit()</code>
        does not invoke destructors and does not invoke any handlers that were
        registered by calling <code>atexit()</code>. If you have a handler that
        needs to run when a program terminates via
        <code>quick_exit()</code> (flushing logs, for example), you can
        register it using <code>at_quick_exit()</code>. (If you have a handler
        that needs to run at both <code>exit()</code> and
        <code>quick_exit()</code>, you need to register it in both places.)
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result we only allow static variables to contain POD data.  This
        rule completely disallows <code>std::vector</code> (use C arrays instead), or
        <code>std::string</code> (use <code>const char []</code>).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you need a static or global variable of a class type, consider
        initializing a pointer (which will never be freed), from either your
        main() function or from pthread_once().  Note that this must be a raw
        pointer, not a "smart" pointer, since the smart pointer's destructor
        will have the order-of-destructor issue that we are trying to avoid.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Doing Work in Constructors">
    <SUMMARY>
      Avoid doing complex initialization in constructors (in particular,
      initialization that can fail or that requires virtual method calls).
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        It is possible to perform initialization in the body of the
        constructor.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Convenience in typing.  No need to worry about whether the
        class has been initialized or not.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        The problems with doing work in constructors are:
        <ul>
          <li> There is no easy way for constructors to signal errors,
               short of using exceptions (which are
               <a href="#Exceptions">forbidden</a>).
               </li>
          <li> If the work fails, we now have an object whose
               initialization code failed, so it may be an
               indeterminate state.
               </li>
          <li> If the work calls virtual functions, these calls will
               not get dispatched to the subclass implementations.
               Future modification to your class can quietly introduce
               this problem even if your class is not currently
               subclassed, causing much confusion.
               </li>
          <li> If someone creates a global variable of this type
               (which is against the rules, but still), the
               constructor code will be called before
               <code>main()</code>, possibly breaking some implicit
               assumptions in the constructor code.  
               </li>
        </ul>
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        Constructors should never call virtual functions or attempt to raise
        non-fatal failures. If your object requires non-trivial
        initialization, consider using  a factory function or <code>Init()</code> method.
      </DECISION>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Initialization">
    <SUMMARY>
      If your class defines member variables, you must provide an
      in-class initializer for every member variable or write a constructor
      (which can be a default constructor). If you do not declare
      any constructors yourself then the compiler will generate a default
      constructor for you, which may leave some fields uninitialized or
      initialized to inappropriate values.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        The default constructor is called when we <code>new</code> a class
        object with no arguments.  It is always called when calling
        <code>new[]</code> (for arrays). In-class member initialization means
        declaring a member variable using a construction like <code>int num_errors_
        = 17;</code> or <code>std::string error_name_{"convergence"};</code>, as opposed to just
        <code>int count_;</code> or <code>std::string name_;</code>.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        <p>
          A user defined default constructor is used to initialize an object
          if no initializer is provided. It can ensure that an object is
          always in a valid and usable state as soon as it's constructed; it
          can also ensure that an object is initially created in an obviously
          "impossible" state, to aid debugging.
        </p>
        <p>
          In-class member initialization ensures that a member variable will
          be initialized appropriately without having to duplicate the
          initialization code in multiple constructors. This can reduce bugs
          where you add a new member variable, initialize it in one
          constructor, and forget to put that initialization code in another
          constructor.
        </p>
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        <p>
          Explicitly defining a default constructor is extra work for
          you, the code writer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In-class member initialization is potentially confusing if a member
          variable is initialized as part of its declaration and also
          initialized in a constructor, since the value in the constructor
          will override the value in the declaration.
        </p>
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Use in-class member initialization for simple initializations,
          especially when a member variable must be initialized the same way
          in more than one constructor.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your class defines member variables that aren't
          initialized in-class, and if it has no other constructors,
          you must define a default constructor (one that takes no
          arguments). It should preferably initialize the object in
          such a way that its internal state is consistent and valid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for this is that if you have no other
          constructors and do not define a default constructor, the
          compiler will generate one for you. This compiler
          generated constructor may not initialize your object
          sensibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your class inherits from an existing class but you add no
          new member variables, you are not required to have a default
          constructor.
          
        </p>
      </DECISION>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Explicit Constructors">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use the C++ keyword <code>explicit</code> for constructors with
      one argument.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        Normally, if a constructor takes one argument, it can be used
        as a conversion.  For instance, if you define
        <code>Foo::Foo(std::string name)</code> and then pass a string to a
        function that expects a <code>Foo</code>, the constructor will
        be called to convert the string into a <code>Foo</code> and
        will pass the <code>Foo</code> to your function for you.  This
        can be convenient but is also a source of trouble when things
        get converted and new objects created without you meaning them
        to.  Declaring a constructor <code>explicit</code> prevents it
        from being invoked implicitly as a conversion.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Avoids undesirable conversions.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        None.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          We require all single argument constructors to be
          explicit. Always put <code>explicit</code> in front of
          one-argument constructors in the class definition:
          <code>explicit Foo(std::string name);</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          The exception is copy constructors, which, in the rare
          cases when we allow them, should probably not be
          <code>explicit</code>.
          
          Classes that are intended to be
          transparent wrappers around other classes are also
          exceptions.
          Such exceptions should be clearly marked with comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, constructors that take only an initializer_list may be
          non-explicit. This is to permit construction of your type using the
          assigment form for brace init lists (i.e. <code>MpmType materials = {1, 2}
          </code>).

  <STYLEPOINT title="Copy Constructors">
    <SUMMARY>
      Provide a copy constructor and assignment operator only when necessary.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        The copy constructor and assignment operator are used to create copies
        of objects. The copy constructor is implicitly invoked by the
        compiler in some situations, e.g. passing objects by value.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Copy constructors make it easy to copy objects.  STL
        containers require that all contents be copyable and
        assignable. Copy constructors can be more efficient than
        <code>CopyFrom()</code>-style workarounds because they combine
        construction with copying, the compiler can elide them in some
        contexts, and they make it easier to avoid heap allocation.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Implicit copying of objects in C++ is a rich source of bugs
        and of performance problems. It also reduces readability, as
        it becomes hard to track which objects are being passed around
        by value as opposed to by reference, and therefore where
        changes to an object are reflected.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Few classes need to be copyable. Most should have neither a
          copy constructor nor an assignment operator. In many situations,
          a pointer or reference will work just as well as a copied value,
          with better performance. For example, you can pass function
          parameters by reference or pointer instead of by value, and you can
          store pointers rather than objects in an STL container.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your class needs to be copyable, prefer providing a copy method,
          such as <code>CopyFrom()</code> or <code>Clone()</code>, rather than
          a copy constructor, because such methods cannot be invoked
          implicitly. If a copy method is insufficient in your situation
          (e.g. for performance reasons, or because your class needs to be
          stored by value in an STL container), provide both a copy
          constructor and assignment operator.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your class does not need a copy constructor or assignment
          operator, you must explicitly disable them.         
          To do so, add dummy declarations for the copy constructor and
          assignment operator in the <code>private:</code> section of your
          class, but do not provide any corresponding definition (so that
          any attempt to use them results in a link error).

  <STYLEPOINT title="Delegating and inheriting constructors">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use delegating and inheriting constructors
      when they reduce code duplication. 
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        <p>
          Delegating and inheriting constructors are two different features,
          both introduced in C++11, for reducing code duplication in
          constructors. Delegating constructors allow one of a class's
          constructors to forward work to one of the class's other
          constructors, using a special variant of the initialization list
          syntax. For example:
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          X::X(const std::string&amp; name) : name_(name) {
            ...
          }

          X::X() : X("") { }
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          Inheriting constructors allow a derived class to have its base
          class's constructors available directly, just as with any of the
          base class's other member functions, instead of having to redeclare
          them. This is especially useful if the base has multiple
          constructors. For example:
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          class Base {
          public:
            Base();
            Base(int n);
            Base(const std::string&amp; s);
            ...
          };

          class Derived : public Base {
          public:
            using Base::Base;  // Base's constructors are redeclared here.
          };
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          This is especially useful when <code>Derived</code>'s constructors
          don't have to do anything more than calling <code>Base</code>'s
          constructors.
        </p>
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        <p>
          Delegating and inheriting constructors reduce verbosity
          and boilerplate, which can improve readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delegating constructors are familiar to Java programmers.
        </p>
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        <p>
          It's possible to approximate the behavior of delegating constructors
          by using a helper function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inheriting constructors may be confusing if a derived class
          introduces new member variables, since the base class constructor
          doesn't know about them.
        </p>
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Use delegating and inheriting
          constructors when they reduce boilerplate and improve
          readability. Be cautious about inheriting
          constructors when your derived class has new member variables.
          Inheriting constructors may still be appropriate in that case
          if you can use in-class member initialization for the derived
          class's member variables.

      Use a <code>struct</code> only for passive objects that carry data;

    <BODY>
      <p>
        The <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code> keywords behave
        almost identically in C++.  We add our own semantic meanings
        to each keyword, so you should use the appropriate keyword for
        the data-type you're defining.

        <code>structs</code> should be used for passive objects that carry
        data, and may have associated constants, but lack any functionality
        other than access/setting the data members. The
        accessing/setting of fields is done by directly accessing the
        fields rather than through method invocations. Methods should

  <STYLEPOINT title="Inheritance">
    <SUMMARY>
      Composition is often more appropriate than inheritance.  When
      using inheritance, make it <code>public</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        When a sub-class inherits from a base class, it includes the
        definitions of all the data and operations that the parent
        base class defines.  In practice, inheritance is used in two
        major ways in C++: implementation inheritance, in which
        actual code is inherited by the child, and <A href="#Interfaces">interface inheritance</A>, in which only
        method names are inherited.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Implementation inheritance reduces code size by re-using the
        base class code as it specializes an existing type.  Because
        inheritance is a compile-time declaration, you and the
        compiler can understand the operation and detect errors.
        Interface inheritance can be used to programmatically enforce
        that a class expose a particular API.  Again, the compiler
        can detect errors, in this case, when a class does not define
        a necessary method of the API.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        For implementation inheritance, because the code implementing
        a sub-class is spread between the base and the sub-class, it
        can be more difficult to understand an implementation.  The
        sub-class cannot override functions that are not virtual, so
        the sub-class cannot change implementation.  The base class
        may also define some data members, so that specifies physical
        layout of the base class.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          All inheritance should be <code>public</code>.  If you want to
          do private inheritance, you should be including an instance of
          the base class as a member instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not overuse implementation inheritance.  Composition is
          often more appropriate. Try to restrict use of inheritance
          to the "is-a" case: <code>Bar</code> subclasses
          <code>Foo</code> if it can reasonably be said that
          <code>Bar</code> "is a kind of" <code>Foo</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make your destructor <code>virtual</code> if necessary. If
          your class has virtual methods, its destructor
          
          should be virtual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limit the use of <code>protected</code> to those member
          functions that might need to be accessed from subclasses.
          Note that <a href="#Access_Control">data members should
          be private</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When redefining an inherited virtual function, explicitly
          declare it <code>virtual</code> in the declaration of the
          derived class.  Rationale: If <code>virtual</code> is
          omitted, the reader has to check all ancestors of the
          class in question to determine if the function is virtual
          or not.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Multiple Inheritance">
    <SUMMARY>
      Only very rarely is multiple implementation inheritance actually

    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        Multiple inheritance allows a sub-class to have more than one
        base class.  We distinguish between base classes that are
        <em>pure interfaces</em> and those that have an
        <em>implementation</em>.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Multiple implementation inheritance may let you re-use even more code
        than single inheritance (see <a href="#Inheritance">Inheritance</a>).
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        Only very rarely is multiple <em>implementation</em>
        inheritance actually useful. When multiple implementation
        inheritance seems like the solution, you can usually find a
        different, more explicit, and cleaner solution.

        <p>
        A class is a interface or an abstract base class if it meets the 
	following requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> It has only public pure virtual ("<code>= 0</code>") methods
               and static methods (but see below for destructor).
               </li>
          <li> It may not have non-static data members.
               </li>
          <li> It need not have any constructors defined.  If a constructor is
               provided, it must take no arguments and it must be protected.
               </li>

          An interface class can never be directly instantiated
          because of the pure virtual method(s) it declares.  To make
          sure all implementations of the interface can be destroyed
          correctly, the interface must also declare a virtual destructor (in
          an exception to the first rule, this should not be pure).  See

      Do not overload operators except in rare, special circumstances.
      Do not create user-defined literals.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        A class can define that operators such as <code>+</code> and
        <code>/</code> operate on the class as if it were a built-in
        type. An overload of <code>operator""</code> allows
        the built-in literal syntax to be used to create objects of
        class types.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        <p>
          Operator overloading can make code appear more intuitive because a
          class will behave in the same way as built-in types (such as
          <code>int</code>).  Overloaded operators are more playful names for
          functions that are less-colorfully named, such as
          <code>Equals()</code> or <code>Add()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some template functions to work correctly, you may need to
          define operators.
        </p>
        <p>
          User-defined literals are a very concise notation for creating
          objects of user-defined types.
        </p>
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        While operator overloading can make code more intuitive, it
        has several drawbacks:
        <ul>
          <li> It can fool our intuition into thinking that expensive
               operations are cheap, built-in operations.
               </li>
          <li> It is much harder to find the call sites for overloaded
               operators.  Searching for <code>Equals()</code> is much
               easier than searching for relevant invocations of
               <code>==</code>.
               </li>
          <li> Some operators work on pointers too, making it easy to
               introduce bugs.  <code>Foo + 4</code> may do one thing,
               while <code>&amp;Foo + 4</code> does something totally
               different. The compiler does not complain for either of
               these, making this very hard to debug.
               </li>
          <li> User-defined literals allow creating new syntactic forms
               that are unfamiliar even to experienced C++ programmers.
               </li>
        </ul>
        Overloading also has surprising ramifications.  For instance,
        if a class overloads unary <code>operator&amp;</code>, it
        cannot safely be forward-declared.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          In general, do not overload operators. The assignment operator
          (<code>operator=</code>), in particular, is insidious and
          should be avoided.  You can define functions like
          <code>Equals()</code> and <code>CopyFrom()</code> if you
          need them.  Likewise, avoid the dangerous
          unary <code>operator&amp;</code> at all costs, if there's
          any possibility the class might be forward-declared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not overload <code>operator""</code>, i.e.
          do not introduce user-defined literals.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there may be rare cases where you need to overload
          an operator to interoperate with templates or "standard" C++
          classes (such as <code>operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp;, const
          T&amp;)</code> for logging).  These are acceptable if fully
          justified, but you should try to avoid these whenever
          possible.  In particular, do not overload <code>operator==</code>
          or <code>operator&lt;</code> just so that your class can be
          used as a key in an STL container; instead, you should
          create equality and comparison functor types when declaring
          the container.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the STL algorithms do require you to overload
          <code>operator==</code>, and you may do so in these cases,
          provided you document why.

    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        In C, if a function needs to modify a variable, the
        parameter must use a pointer, e.g., <code>int foo(int
        *pval)</code>.  In C++, the function can alternatively
        declare a reference parameter: <code>int foo(int
        &amp;val)</code>.
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Defining a parameter as reference avoids ugly code like
        <code>(*pval)++</code>.  Necessary for some applications like
        copy constructors.  Makes it clear, unlike with pointers, that
        a null pointer is not a possible value.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        References can be confusing, as they have value syntax but
        pointer semantics.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Within function parameter lists all references must be
          <code>const</code>:
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          void foo(const std::string &amp;in, std::string *out);
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          The input arguments are values or <code>const</code> references,
	  while output arguments are pointers.  Input parameters may be
          <code>const</code> pointers, but never use non-<code>const</code> 
	  reference parameters except when required by convention,
	  e.g., <code>swap()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>

         However, there are some instances where using <code>const T*</code>
         is preferable to <code>const T&amp;</code> for input parameters. For
         example:
         <ul>
           <li>You want to pass in a null pointer.</li>
           <li>The function saves a pointer or reference to the input.</li>
         </ul>
         

         Remember that most of the time input parameters are going to be
         specified as <code>const T&amp;</code>.  Using <code>const T*</code>
         instead communicates to the reader that the input is somehow treated
         differently.  So if you choose <code>const T*</code> rather than
         <code>const T&amp;</code>, do so for a concrete reason; otherwise it
         will likely confuse readers by making them look for an explanation

  <STYLEPOINT title="Casting">
    <SUMMARY>
      Casts are generally best avoided. In worst case, use C++ casts like
      <code>static_cast&lt;&gt;()</code>. Do not use other cast formats 
      like <code>int y = (int)x;</code> or <code>int y = int(x);</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        With the exception of dynamic_cast, the use of cast implies the possibility of a type error or 
	the truncation of a numeric value.  Even an innocent-looking cast can become a serious problem if,
	during development or maintenance, one of the types involved is changed.
	C++ introduced a different cast system from C that distinguishes the types of cast operations.
      </DEFINITION>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          Casts are generally best avoided. In worst case, use these C++-style

  <STYLEPOINT title="Preincrement and Predecrement">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use prefix form (<code>++i</code>) of the increment and
      decrement operators with iterators and other template objects.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        When a variable is incremented (<code>++i</code> or
        <code>i++</code>) or decremented (<code>--i</code> or
        <code>i--</code>) and the value of the expression is not used,
        one must decide whether to preincrement (decrement) or
        postincrement (decrement).
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        When the return value is ignored, the "pre" form
        (<code>++i</code>) is never less efficient than the "post"
        form (<code>i++</code>), and is often more efficient.  This is
        because post-increment (or decrement) requires a copy of
        <code>i</code> to be made, which is the value of the
        expression.  If <code>i</code> is an iterator or other
        non-scalar type, copying <code>i</code> could be expensive.
        Since the two types of increment behave the same when the
        value is ignored, why not just always pre-increment?
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        The traditionally, post-increment is used when
        the expression value is not used, especially in <code>for</code>
        loops.  Some find post-increment easier to read, since the
        "subject" (<code>i</code>) precedes the "verb" (<code>++</code>),
        just like in English.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        For simple scalar (non-object) values there is no reason to
        prefer one form and we allow either.  For iterators and other
        template types, use pre-increment.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Use of const">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use <code>const</code> whenever it makes sense.

      about const correctness.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <DEFINITION>
        Declared variables and parameters can be preceded by the
        keyword <code>const</code> to indicate the variables are not
        changed (e.g., <code>const int foo</code>).  Class functions
        can have the <code>const</code> qualifier to indicate the
        function does not change the state of the class member
        variables (e.g., <code>class Foo { int Bar(char c) const;
        };</code>).
      </DEFINITION>
      <PROS>
        Easier for people to understand how variables are being used.
        Allows the compiler to do better type checking, and,
        conceivably, generate better code.  Helps people convince
        themselves of program correctness because they know the
        functions they call are limited in how they can modify your
        variables.  Helps people know what functions are safe to use
        without locks in multi-threaded programs.
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        <code>const</code> is viral: if you pass a <code>const</code>
        variable to a function, that function must have <code>const</code>
        in its prototype (or the variable will need a
        <code>const_cast</code>).  This can be a particular problem
        when calling library functions.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          <code>const</code> variables, data members, methods and
          arguments add a level of compile-time type checking; it
          is better to detect errors as soon as possible.
          Therefore we strongly recommend that you use
          <code>const</code> whenever it makes sense to do so:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> If a function does not modify an argument passed by
               reference or by pointer, that argument should be
               <code>const</code>.
               </li>
          <li> Declare methods to be <code>const</code> whenever
               possible. Accessors should almost always be
               <code>const</code>. Other methods should be const if they do
               not modify any data members, do not call any
               non-<code>const</code> methods, and do not return a
               non-<code>const</code> pointer or non-<code>const</code>
               reference to a data member.
               </li>
          <li> Consider making data members <code>const</code>
               whenever they do not need to be modified after
               construction.
               </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <code>mutable</code> keyword is allowed but is unsafe
          when used with threads, so thread safety should be carefully
          considered first.
        </p>
      </DECISION>
      <SUBSECTION title="Where to put the const">
        <p>
          Use <code>const int* foo</code> as it is more idiomatic.
          Putting the <code>const</code> first is arguably more readable,
          since it follows English in putting the "adjective"
          (<code>const</code>) before the "noun" (<code>int</code>).
        </p>
	<p>
	  Note that in const pointer, "const" always comes after the

        Some variables can be declared <code>constexpr</code>

        Prematurely marking something as constexpr

        <p>
          "Ownership" is a bookkeeping technique for managing dynamically
          allocated memory (and other resources). The owner of a dynamically
          allocated object is an object or function that is responsible for
          ensuring that it is deleted when no longer needed. Ownership can
          sometimes be shared, in which case the last owner is typically
          responsible for deleting it. Even when ownership is not shared,
          it can be transferred from one piece of code to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Smart" pointers are classes that act like pointers, e.g. by
          overloading the <code>*</code> and <code>-&gt;</code> operators.
          Some smart pointer types can be used to automate ownership
          bookkeeping, to ensure these responsibilities are met.
          <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">
          <code>std::unique_ptr</code></a> is a smart pointer type introduced

          allocated object; the object is deleted when the
          <code>std::unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope. It cannot be copied,
          but can be <em>moved</em> to represent ownership transfer. 
          <code>shared_ptr</code> is a smart pointer type which expresses
          shared ownership of a dynamically allocated object. 
          <code>shared_ptr</code>s can be copied; ownership of the object is
          shared among all copies, and the object is deleted when the last

        <ul>
          <li>It's virtually impossible to manage dynamically allocated memory
            without some sort of ownership logic.</li>
          <li>Transferring ownership of an object can be cheaper than copying
            it (if copying it is even possible).</li>
          <li>Transferring ownership can be simpler than 'borrowing' a pointer
            or reference, because it reduces the need to coordinate the
            lifetime of the object between the two users.</li>
          <li>Smart pointers can improve readability by making ownership logic
            explicit, self-documenting, and unambiguous.</li>
          <li>Smart pointers can eliminate manual ownership bookkeeping,
            simplifying the code and ruling out large classes of errors.</li>
          <li>For const objects, shared ownership can be a simple and efficient
            alternative to deep copying.</li>
        </ul>
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
        <ul>
          <li>Ownership must be represented and transferred via pointers
            (whether smart or plain). Pointer semantics are more complicated
            than value semantics, especially in APIs: you have to worry not
            just about ownership, but also aliasing, lifetime, and mutability,
            among other issues.</li>
          <li>The performance costs of value semantics are often overestimated,
            so the performance benefits of ownership transfer might not justify
            the readability and complexity costs.</li>
          <li>APIs that transfer ownership force their clients into a single
            memory management model.</li>
          <li>Code using smart pointers is less explicit about where the
            resource releases take place.</li>
          <li><code>std::unique_ptr</code> expresses ownership transfer
            using C++11's move semantics, which are
            <a href="#Rvalue_references">generally forbidden</a> in Google
            code, and may confuse some programmers.</li>
          <li>Shared ownership can be a tempting alternative to careful
            ownership design, obfuscating the design of a system.</li>
          <li>Shared ownership requires explicit bookkeeping at run-time,
            which can be costly.</li>
          <li>In some cases (e.g. cyclic references), objects with shared
            ownership may never be deleted.</li>
          <li>Smart pointers are not perfect substitutes for plain
            pointers.</li>
        </ul>
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          If dynamic allocation is necessary, prefer to keep ownership with
          the code that allocated it. If other code needs access to the object,
          consider passing it a copy, or passing a pointer or reference
          without transferring ownership. Prefer to use
          <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to make ownership transfer explicit.
          For example:
            <CODE_SNIPPET>
              std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; FooFactory();
              void FooConsumer(std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; ptr);
            </CODE_SNIPPET>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not design your code to use shared ownership without a very good
          reason. One such reason is to avoid expensive copy operations,
          but you should only do this if the performance benefits are
          significant, and the underlying object is immutable (i.e.
          <code>shared_ptr&lt;const Foo&gt;</code>).  If you do use shared
          ownership, prefer to use <code>shared_ptr</code>.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not use <code>scoped_ptr</code> in new code unless you need to be
          compatible with older versions of C++. Never use
          <code>linked_ptr</code> or <code>std::auto_ptr</code>. In all three
          cases, use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> instead.

    <BODY>
      <SUBSECTION title="Function Declarations">
        <p>
          Every function declaration should have comments immediately
          preceding it that describe what the function does and how to
          use it.  These comments should be descriptive ("Opens the
          file ... ") rather than imperative ("Open the file"); the comment
          describes the function, it does not tell the function what
          to do.  In general, these comments do not describe how the
          function performs its task.  Instead, that should be left to
          comments in the function definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Types of things to mention in comments at the function
          declaration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> What the inputs and outputs are.
               </li>
          <li> For class member functions:  whether the object
               remembers reference arguments beyond the
               duration of the method call, and whether it will
               free them or not.
               </li>
          <li> If the function allocates memory that the caller
               must free.
               </li>
          <li> Whether any of the arguments can be a null pointer.
               </li>
          <li> If there are any performance implications of how a
               function is used.
               </li>
          <li> If the function is re-entrant.  What are its
               synchronization assumptions?
               </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here is an example:
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          // Apply a given functor to all particles making use of std::for_each
          // \tparam OP         Type of the particle operation
          // \param[in,out] op  Specific operation applied to all particles

          }
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          However, do not be unnecessarily verbose or state the
          completely obvious.  Notice below that it is not necessary
          to say "returns false otherwise" because this is implied.
        </p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          // Returns true if the table cannot hold any more entries.
          bool is_table_full();
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
        <p>
          When commenting constructors and destructors, remember that
          the person reading your code knows what constructors and
          destructors are for, so comments that just say something like
          "destroys this object" are not useful.  Document what
          constructors do with their arguments (for example, if they
          take ownership of pointers), and what cleanup the destructor
          does.  If this is trivial, just skip the comment.  It is
          quite common for destructors not to have a header comment.
        </p>
      </SUBSECTION>

      <SUBSECTION title="Function Definitions">
        <p>
          If there is anything tricky about how a function does its
          job, the function definition should have an explanatory
          comment. For example, in the definition comment you might
          describe any coding tricks you use, give an overview of the
          steps you go through, or explain why you chose to implement
          the function in the way you did rather than using a viable
          alternative.  For instance, you might mention why it must
          acquire a lock for the first half of the function but why it
          is not needed for the second half.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note you should <em>not</em> just repeat the comments given
          with the function declaration, in the <code>.h</code> file or
          wherever.  It's okay to recapitulate briefly what the function
          does, but the focus of the comments should be on how it does it.

          special meanings, such as a null pointer or -1, document this.
          For example:

          private:

        Although it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point
        out that you are using a comma when you should be using a
        semicolon, it is very important that source code maintain a
        high level of clarity and readability.  Proper punctuation,
        spelling, and grammar help with that goal.

  <STYLEPOINT title="TODO Comments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use <code>TODO</code> comments for code that is temporary, a
      short-term solution, or good-enough but not perfect.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        <code>TODO</code>s should include the string <code>TODO</code> in
        all caps, followed by the name, e-mail address, or other identifier
        of the person who can best provide context about the problem
        referenced by the <code>TODO</code>.  A colon is optional.  The main
        purpose is to have a consistent <code>TODO</code> format that can be
        searched to find the person who can provide more details upon request.
        A <code>TODO</code> is not a commitment that the person referenced
        will fix the problem.  Thus when you create a <code>TODO</code>, it is
        almost always your name that is given.
      </p>
      
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // TODO(kks32[at]cam.ac.uk): Use a "*" here for concatenation operator.
        // TODO(ks207) change this to use relations.
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        If your <code>TODO</code> is of the form "At a future date do
        something" make sure that you either include a very specific
        date ("Fix by November 2005") or a very specific event
        ("Remove this code when all clients can handle XML responses.").

  <STYLEPOINT title="Deprecation Comments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Mark deprecated interface points with <code>DEPRECATED</code> comments.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
      You can mark an interface as deprecated by writing a comment containing
      the word <code>DEPRECATED</code> in all caps.  The comment goes either
      before the declaration of the interface or on the same line as the
      declaration.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      After the word <code>DEPRECATED</code>, write your name, e-mail address,
      or other identifier in parentheses.
      </p>
      <p>
      A deprecation comment must include simple, clear directions for people to
      fix their callsites.  In C++, you can implement a deprecated function as
      an inline function that calls the new interface point.
      </p>
      <p>
      Marking an interface point <code>DEPRECATED</code> will not magically
      cause any callsites to change.  If you want people to actually stop using
      the deprecated facility, you will have to fix the callsites yourself or
      recruit a crew to help you.
      </p>
      <p>
      New code should not contain calls to deprecated interface points.  Use
      the new interface point instead.  If you cannot understand the
      directions, find the person who created the deprecation and ask them for
      help using the new interface point.

<CATEGORY title="Formatting">
  <p>
    Coding style and formatting are pretty arbitrary, but a project
    is much easier to follow if everyone uses the same style. Individuals
    may not agree with every aspect of the formatting rules, and some of
    the rules may take some getting used to, but it is important that all
    project contributors follow the style rules so that
    
    they
    can all read and understand everyone's code easily.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To help you format code correctly, there are some tools available. See
    <a href="#Formatting_Tools">Formatting Tools</a> for more
    information.
  </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Line Length">
    <SUMMARY>
      Each line of text in your code should be at most 80 characters
      long.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      
      <p>
        We recognize that this rule is controversial, but so much existing
        code already adheres to it, and we feel that consistency is
        important.
      </p>
      <PROS>
          Those who favor this rule argue
          that it is rude to force them to resize their windows and there
          is no need for anything longer.  Some folks are used to having
          several code windows side-by-side, and thus don't have room to
          widen their windows in any case.  People set up their work
          environment assuming a particular maximum window width, and 80
          columns has been the traditional standard.  Why change it?
      </PROS>
      <CONS>
          Proponents of change argue that a wider line can make code
          more readable.  The 80-column limit is an hidebound
          throwback to 1960s mainframes; modern equipment has
          wide screens that can easily show longer lines.
      </CONS>
      <DECISION>
        <p>
          80 characters is the maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exception: if a comment line contains an example command or
          a literal URL longer than 80 characters, that line may be
          longer than 80 characters for ease of cut and paste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exception: an <code>#include</code> statement with a long
          path may exceed 80 columns.  Try to avoid situations where this
          becomes necessary.
        </p>

        You should use UTF-8, since that is  
        an encoding understood by most tools able
        to handle more than just ASCII.
      </p>
      <p>
        You shouldn't use the C++11 <code>char16_t</code> and
        <code>char32_t</code> character types, since they're for
        non-UTF-8 text. For similar reasons you also shouldn't use

        Note that when the code wraps in this example, both of

  <STYLEPOINT title="Vertical Whitespace">
    <SUMMARY>
      Minimize use of vertical whitespace.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        This is more a principle than a rule: don't use blank lines
        when you don't have to.  In particular, don't put more than
        one or two blank lines between functions, resist starting
        functions with a blank line, don't end functions with a blank
        line, and be discriminating with your use of blank lines
        inside functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic principle is: The more code that fits on one screen,
        the easier it is to follow and understand the control flow of
        the program.  Of course, readability can suffer from code
        being too dense as well as too spread out, so use your
        judgement.  But in general, minimize use of vertical
        whitespace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some rules of thumb to help when blank lines may be useful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Blank lines at the beginning or end of a function very
             rarely help readability.
             </li>
        <li> Blank lines inside a chain of if-else blocks may well
             help readability.

    If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the
    code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces
    around their <code>if</code> clauses, you should, too. If
    their comments have little boxes of stars around them, make
    your comments have little boxes of stars around them too.
  </p>
  <p>
    The point of having style guidelines is to have a common
    vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are
    saying, rather than on how you are saying it.  We present
    global style rules here so people know the vocabulary. But
    local style is also important.  If code you add to a file
    looks drastically different from the existing code around it,
    the discontinuity throws readers out of their rhythm when they
    go to read it. Try to avoid this.
